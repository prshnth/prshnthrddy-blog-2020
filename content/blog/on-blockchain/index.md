After spending some quality time reading and investing on Cryptocurrencies I have finally come to an understanding that it doesn’t deserve the hype it has right now.

Before I explain further I would like to make something very clear (at least to myself) that this is my limited understanding and I know I can be proved wrong. But for what its worth here’s my take on Crypto hype.

> My reasoning is entirely philosophical, I have absolutely ZERO technical knowledge on Blockhain on which all these cryptocurrencies sit.

Human beings from the time of evolution move in groups, they identify themselves with a particular set of people/ideas/beliefs and tend to follow the leader of the pack. Most of us are happy to lead our lives by giving responsibility to a person or an organization whom/which we can hold accountable for when things go wrong.

In our social gatherings we sit together and bitch about these leaders and organizations. We fantasize about an ideal society where we are our own boss and no one is controlling us but in reality we like to be controlled, we idolize the leader we believe in, we transfer them power so that we can go about our lives.

Cryptocurrencies which sit on Blockchain technology eliminate these middlemen, these leaders and organizations. We are responsible to keep the private key safe and if that’s lost we don’t have anyone to talk to, it can’t be reversed. Once you lose your key, It’s DONE.

> Blockchain gives individual person so much power but are we as a society ready for it yet?

As humans we are supposed to make mistakes, we are supposed to be stupid, we are supposed to evolve and learn from our mistakes and most importantly we are are supposed to argue with each other, “What constitutes a mistake?”. And we are happy to leave this discussion to the better thinkers. Because we want middlemen, we want someone whom we can trust and we also want to reserve the right to blame them later when things go bad.

The reason why I say in my title that I’m giving up ‘for now’ is because Blockchain has tremendous potential but I don’t see a mass market use case for it yet. For instance, we’ve been using Siri and Google assistant for years but one day Jeff Bezos walks into the party and asks why is this being bundled with a phone and why can’t this be a separate device? and starts selling Echo and since then Apple and Google are just playing catch up. I’m waiting for someone to figure that out with Blockchain. Till then, Blockchain, girl you are beautiful but I’m just not that into you right now.

P.S. All my opinions are HEAVILY influenced [from this article](https://hackernoon.com/ten-years-in-nobody-has-come-up-with-a-use-case-for-blockchain-ee98c180100), if you’d like a more detailed and nuanced take on this topic please do read it, it’s a great piece.
